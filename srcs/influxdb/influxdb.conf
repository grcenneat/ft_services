###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place

  # The size of the internal cache used in the TSI index to store previously
  # calculated series results. Cached results will be returned quickly from the cache rather
  # than needing to be recalculated when a subsequent query with a matching tag key/value
  # predicate is executed. Setting this value to 0 will disable the cache, which may
  # lead to query performance issues.
  # This value should only be increased if it is known that the set of regularly used
  # tag key/value predicates across all measurements for a database is larger than 100. An
  # increase in cache size may lead to an increase in heap usage.
